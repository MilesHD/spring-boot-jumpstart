# Tomcat Configuration

One of the best things about Spring Boot is its automatic
configuration. The tool handles spinning up a Tomcat Instance
for you and bootstrapping your application as a servlet if you
so desire. You can configure a Tomcat instance in a number of
different ways.

Modifying your `application.properties` allows you to specify
configuration in dot notation. (ex: tomcat.server.port = 8000)
